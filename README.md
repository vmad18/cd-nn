Cancer Detect Neural Network
- Early detection of 8 cancer types from human blood plasma samples via a neural network. 
- Inspiration from research paper published in Science, "Detection and localization of surgically resectable cancers with a multi-analyte blood test."
- Used in local science fair, where I was interviewed for ISEF.
